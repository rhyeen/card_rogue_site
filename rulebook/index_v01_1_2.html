                <h3>About the game</h3>
                <p>Card Rogue is a tribute to the classic Rogue dungeon crawling game.  Rogue was a computer game released in the 1980’s that featured many of the aspects that are present in this game; tributes to Rogue are appropriately named roguelike video games. Unlike other roguelikes, Card Rogue is playable with a group of friends and away from the computer.</p>
				<p>Card Rogue is a challenging game that requires an equal amount of luck and skill.  One to four players try to survive the mysteries of the dangerous catacombs. The game board is randomly created as the players make their way down uncertain paths. Thus, every game is different and requires a unique approach.</p>
				<p>To survive, a player must be lucky, adaptable, and tactical. Traps, enemies, loot, or fame are met around every corner. Players must sometimes ally together, but other times they must betray that trust. Only the strongest and smartest will make it out alive.</p>
                
				<h3 id="The-story">The story</h3>
				<p>Stories tell of an ancient cult of sorcerers.  Desiring power, they once conjured dark magics that spread fear throughout the land.  Great heroes were summoned to drive back the sorcerers.  As a countermeasure, the sorcerers sculpted a giant clay golem and used their magic to bring it to life.  Though none of the heroes were able to defeat the monster, their perseverance forced the sorcerers to hide underground.  Though the darkness was suppressed, the catacombs were never discovered.</p>
                <p>History turned into legend and the catacombs were all but forgotten.  That is, until the caravan of a debt-ridden merchant collapsed through the ground.  The merchant found himself trapped in a labyrinth of underground passageways.  He dared not wander from where he fell, as the passages were riddled with horrific monsters and deadly traps.</p>
                <p class="page-break-after-print">The cave-in was soon discovered, and a ladder was lowered to the merchant.  He told the local village of what he discovered and vowed to aid any explorer willing to enter.  Word spread across the kingdom, and fame-seeking mercenaries began to enter the underground lair.  Will you face your fears and enter the catacombs?  Will you bring home stories of great deeds and moments of glory?  Or will you fall to the darkness that awaits you below?</p>
				
                <h3>About the rulebook</h3>
                <aside>In the rulebook, the reader will sometimes see side notes like this.  These notes are to help clarify complex rules or to explain exceptional rules.  They can safely be avoided unless a certain gameplay mechanic isn't clear.</aside>
                <p>Card Rogue is a game about exploration and discovery.  This means the rulebook can be a bit intimidating.  Players are encouraged to read the rulebook and play the game in unison.  Start by reading the <a class="rulebook" href="#Goal-the-game">Goal of the game</a> and <a class="rulebook" href="#Setting-up">Setting up the play area</a> sections.  The rulebook will explain a part of the game, and the players should play up to that point.  The sections should be used as a reference when new cards are introduced, or when players aren’t clear about certain rules or game mechanics.</p>
                <aside>In order to simplify the reading of this rulebook, the pronoun “he” is used when referring to a player or enemy.  However, we strongly encourage both girls and guys to play this game.  If there was a word in the English language that suggests ‘he or she’, we would have used it.</aside>
				<p>Often times, the simple descriptions given in the rulebook are not enough detail.  At the end of the rulebook is a <a class="rulebook" href="#Clarifications">Clarifications</a> section.  Many terms in the rulebook are <a>underlined</a>. This means further explanations can be read in the Clarifications section. Additionally, players can look up specific card descriptions for further clarification.</p>
				

				<h2>Starting the game</h2>
                <h3 id="Goal-the-game">Goal of the game</h3>
                <h4>Playing with friends</h4>
                <aside>The game can even be played by a single player.  Read <a class="rulebook" href="#Playing-by-yourself">Playing by yourself</a> below for single-player specific rules.</aside>
                <p>Card Rogue is meant to be played by a group of friends.  The game includes enough player-tokens and character cards for four players, but more players can be added using enough creativity.</p>
                <img alt="Victory Point" src="images/victory_point.png" height="90"><p>The goal of the game is to gain the most <a href="#Victory-point">victory points</a>.  Victory points are awarded for completing certain goals that are outlined at the end of the rulebook.  The winning player is the one who has the most victory points when the game ends.  Although the players are competing, they must also work together to complete some of the challenges.  An intelligent player knows when to help his friends, and when to betray them.  Many of these challenges are far too difficult to face when the game begins.  To overcome these challenges, players will explore the catacombs for better equipment and magical items.</p>
                <h4 id="Playing-by-yourself">Playing by yourself</h4>
                <p>A single person can casually play the game by himself.  The player should decide which of the <a class="rulebook" href="#Goals">goals</a> he wants to accomplish before starting the game.  Perhaps the player is only interested in fulfilling a single goal.  Perhaps he wants more of a challenge, and decides to complete all the goals.  In order for the single player to succeed, he must accomplish all designated goals and leave the dungeon safely without <a href="#Death">dying</a>.  Single player rules are meant to be modified to the preference of the player.  A player can modify certain in-game rules to better fit his playing pleasure.</p>

                <h4 id="Story-mode">Story mode</h4>
                <p>As a separate form of play, a single player can play using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ejVWqiF6dad5zq7U9SzcgXqZusCjiwX4Qt6zoQM_7-U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">story mode rules</a>.  Story mode is a version of the game that has a predefined dungeon to explore.  The experience is more like a puzzle, as players will need to learn the perfect set of moves to make it out of the dungeon alive.  Each level of the dungeon is prefaced with a story that unfolds the mystery of the dungeon.</p>

                <p>After reading the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ejVWqiF6dad5zq7U9SzcgXqZusCjiwX4Qt6zoQM_7-U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Story Mode Rulebook</a>, play the first campaign: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T8fubyL3Ao4f7kp3WsciDbTfoXxDzHmrfdS8YHZMa5c/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">A Son’s Descent</a>.</p>

                <p>Players may also submit their own story mode campaigns, called community challenge maps.  Players can compete for a high score on a challenge map by seeing who can discover the quickest way to complete the challenge.  Read more about how you can get involved in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ejVWqiF6dad5zq7U9SzcgXqZusCjiwX4Qt6zoQM_7-U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Story Mode Rulebook</a>.</p>

				<h3 id="Setting-up">Setting up the play area</h3>
                <h4>Remove extra cards</h4>
                <p>Card Rogue comes with a few spare cards, in case some get lost, and a few cards only used in <a href="#Story-mode">Story mode</a>.  Before beginning normal play, remove the <a href="#Descending-ladder">descending ladder card</a> from the <a href="#Starting-tile">starting tiles</a>, and all <a href="#Spare-card">spare cards</a> from the different decks.</p>
                <h4>Arrange the cards</h4>
                <img alt="Representation of different card types" class="graphic" src="images/card_types.png">
                <p>To start the game, players should gather around a large table.    Shuffle the <a href="#Exploration-card">exploration cards</a> and place them face-down in one stack.  Shuffle the <a href="#Pathing-tile">pathing tiles</a> and place them  face-down in another stack.  All <a href="#Gold-card">gold cards</a>, <a href="#Shop-card">shop cards</a>, and <a href="#Effect-card">effect cards</a> should be placed in separate piles.  There should also be an area reserved for a discard pile. The remaining cards are the <a href="#Starting-tile">starting tiles</a>.  Each player should take one of these tiles.  The rest can be discarded.</p>

				
                <h4 id="Deciding-roll">The deciding roll and characters</h4>
				<img alt="Back of Character Card" class="card-small" src="images/cards/cb_character.png"><p>Once everything is set up, each player rolls the die.  Whoever rolls the highest gets to start the game.  The starting player picks one of the <a href="#Character-card">character cards</a>, and a <a href="#Player-token">player-token</a>.  The next player, to the left of the starting player, picks next, and the order continues clockwise.</p>
                <p>Every player plays the game the same way.  The character cards, however, give each player unique traits that are expressive of that character.</p>
                <p class="page-break-after-print">If a player chooses the <a href="#Mage">Mage</a> as a character, he should also take the <a href="#Cooldown-card">cooldown effect card</a> from the effect cards deck.</p>
                
                <h4>Convenient Cards</h4>
				<img alt="Preview of Score Sheet" class="card-small" src="images/score_sheet_comp.png" style="border-radius:0"><img alt="Back of Equipment Card" class="card-small" src="images/cards/cb_equipment.png"><img alt="Back of Reference Card" class="card-small" src="images/cards/cb_reference.png"><p>Once every player has chosen a character card, they should each take a pen or pencil and a <a href="#Score-sheet">score sheet</a>, which they will update as the game progresses.  Unless specified, each player starts with 10 maximum health.  This should be recorded on the score sheet. Every player starts with no change to the <a href="#Attack-roll">attack roll</a>, and a score of 0. You can <a href="../print/index.html" target="_blank">download the score sheet as a pdf</a> from the Print page.</p>
                <p>Each player should also take an <a href="#Equipment-card">equipment card</a>.  Players will use this card to keep track of equipped weapons and armor.</p>
                <p>Finally, players should take a <a href="#Reference-card">Reference card</a>. 
                <h3>First move</h3>
                
                <p>The game begins with the <a class="rulebook" href="#Deciding-roll">starting player</a> placing his <a href="#Starting-tile">starting tile</a>, face-up, on the table in front of him.  This should be placed as close to the player as possible, so that one path on the starting tile would lead off of the tabletop surface.  That path is not <a class="rulebook" href="#Walls-and-paths">explorable</a> and is treated as a <a class="rulebook" href="#Walls-and-paths">wall</a>.  The player places his <a href="#Player-token">player-token</a> on the starting tile.</p>
                <p>The next player begins by placing four <a href="#Exploration-card">exploration cards</a>, face-down, in a tight line to the left of the starting player’s starting tile.  These cards keep the game in a tight grid, and separate the players in the beginning.  Next, he places his starting tile down following the four exploration cards, and places his player-token on it. All players follow likewise, connecting all starting tiles with face-down exploration cards.</p>
                <p>Depending on the layout of the players and the shape of the tabletop, players may need to deviate from this pattern.  Whatever pattern is chosen, each starting tile needs to be at least four exploration cards away from each other.  The game must keep a grid-like shape.  Players can only place a card to the left, right, top, or bottom of another card.
                <p>Additionally, all edges of starting tiles should have a face-down exploration card next to it, excluding the edge that is against the edge of the tabletop.</p>

                <h2 id="Turns">Turns</h2>
                <h3 id="Turn-sequence">Standard turn sequence</h3>
                
                <p>Once the initial setup is completed, the regular game sequence begins.  Each player is presented with a sequence of operations that he may perform during his turn.  The standard turn sequence steps are:</p>
                <aside><b>An example turn:</b> the player flips over an adjacent face-down card and a shop is revealed. The player flips over another face-down card and a spike trap is revealed, which reduces his health by 2.  The player decides to move onto the shop tile, and buys from the shop.  Finally, the player places additional exploration cards face-down adjacent to the shop card.</aside>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Flip adjacent cards:</b> The player may flip over face-down <a href="#Exploration-card">exploration cards</a> that are adjacent (directly up, down, left, or right of) his current tile.  The player may flip over any or all <a href="#Adjacent-tile">adjacent cards</a> in one turn, but must interact with the following cards when they are flipped over:</li>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>If the card is a <a href="#Trap">trap</a>, the trap is triggered and inflicts the player.</li>
                        <li>If the card is an <a href="#Artifact">artifact</a>, he must pick up the card, and replace it with a <a href="#Pathing-tile">Pathing tile</a>.</li>
						<li>If the card is an <a href="#Enemy">enemy</a>, the player <a class="rulebook" href="#Combat">enters combat</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>Move:</b> The player may move his player token onto an <a href="#Adjacent-tile">adjacent</a> face-up card that is not occupied by another player or enemy.
                        <ul>
                        	<li>If he moves onto a <a href="#Trap">trap</a>, the trap is triggered and inflicts the player.</li>
                            <li>If he moves onto a <a href="#Potion">potion</a>, he MUST pick up the card, and replace it with a Pathing Tile.</li>
                            <li>If he moves onto a <a href="#Shop">shop</a>, he may <a href="#Buy">buy</a> and <a href="#Sell">sell</a> with the shopkeeper.</li>
                            <li>If he moves onto a <a href="#Fountain-of-healing">fountain of healing</a>, he will interact with it at the start of his next turn.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Interact:</b> If the player moves adjacent to an enemy, the player enters combat. Otherwise, if a player is adjacent to another player, he may interact with that player. <aside class="not-aside">See <a class="rulebook" href="#Interact">Interacting with other players</a> for more details</aside></li>
                    <li><b>Place exploration cards:</b> The player places face-down exploration cards on his current pathing tile if paths lead to unexplored areas.  <aside class="not-aside">See <a class="rulebook" href="#Walls-and-paths">the following section</a> for more details.</aside></li>
                </ol>

                <p>If the only action taken by the player was to move his player token, and the player did not interact with another card or player, he may repeat his turn from step 2.  Once a player’s turn is over, the next player takes his turn.
</p>
				<h3 id="Walls-and-paths">Walls and paths</h3>
                <p><a href="#Pathing-tile">Pathing tiles</a> are represented as stone paths of a face-up card.  Pathing tiles can be flipped over (face-up) <a href="#Exploration-card">exploration cards</a> or cards from the <a href="#Pathing-tile">pathing tile</a> stack.  Each pathing tile has a certain number of paths, ranging from 1 to 4, leading off of the edges of the card.  When a player moves onto a pathing tile, he lays exploration cards face-down next to any path on that tile that does not lead to an already placed card.  All edges of pathing tiles that do not have paths are walls.  If one pathing tile leads to another pathing tile that has no connecting edge (because it is a wall), then that edge is counted as a wall. Players cannot move through a wall to an <a href="#Adjacent-tile">adjacent tile</a>.</p>
                <img alt="Representation of Valid Moves" class="graphic-mid page-break-after-print" src="images/place_move2.png">
                <p>When a player flips an exploration card to reveal a pathing tile, he should rotate the tile so its paths connect with his current tile's path. Pathing tiles that have a red arrow should be rotated such that the arrow is pointing away from the tile the player is currently standing on.</p>
                <img alt="Representation of flipping and rotating a card" class="graphic" style="margin-bottom:150px;" src="images/flip_card.png">

                <img alt="Example Enemy card" class="card-small" src="images/cards/ex_goblin.png">
                <p>When a player flips over an <a href="#Enemy">enemy</a>, or a player moves to an <a href="#Adjacent-tile">adjacent tile</a> of a revealed enemy, that player must enter combat with the enemy.  Entering combat starts the combat turn sequence, and the <a class="rulebook" href="#Turn-sequence">standard turn sequence</a> for that player is skipped until after he leaves combat.</p><br>
                <h4 id="Combat-sequence">Combat Turn Sequence</h4>
                <ol>
                	<li><b>Roll for attack or flee:</b> The player rolls a die.  This is called an <a href="#Attack-roll">attack roll</a>.  The player will deal the rolled amount to the enemy’s health after applying any attack modifiers.    The enemy’s starting  (max) health is listed on the enemy card.<br>
Instead of rolling an attack roll, the player may attempt to <a class="rulebook" href="#Flee">flee</a>.  Read the following section for more information.</li>
<img alt="Example Enemy card with special ability" class="card-small" style="float:right; margin-right:0; margin-left:20px" src="images/cards/ex_vampireB.png">
                    <li><b>Apply enemy ability (if any):</b> If the enemy has a special ability that require a die roll, roll for this ability. Apply the ability if the roll matches the ability's required roll, or if the ability does not require a roll.  Ability descriptions can be found in the <a class="rulebook" href="#Clarifications">Clarifications</a> section. Look up the ability itself, and not the name of the enemy.</li>
                    
                    <li><b>Enemy attacks:</b> The enemy will attack the player.  The player will lose health equal to the attack amount listed on the enemy card after applying any defense altering effects.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>A player keeps track of his current health and the current health of the combating enemy on the <a href="#Score-sheet">score sheet</a>.  If neither the player or enemy are slain during this turn, the player ends his turn and must start the combat turn sequence again next turn.  If the player is affected (by <a href="#Paralysis">paralysis</a> or <a href="#Poison">poison</a>) those effects will continue during the start of the next combat turn sequence. If the player loses all his health, he <a href="#Death">dies</a>. If the enemy loses all his health, he is slain.</p>
                <aside class="not-aside">See <a class="rulebook" href="#Player-dies">Player dies</a> below for more detail.</aside>

                <h4 id="Flee">Fleeing from an enemy</h4>
                <p>During the player’s turn of the combat turn sequence (step 1), he can choose to flee instead of attacking by announcing that he is attempting to flee. The player rolls a die.   If the player  rolls a 1, 2, or 3 the player failed to flee and the combat turn sequence will continue at step 2. Otherwise, he can flee from an enemy by moving his player token to an adjacent tile away from the enemy. Players may perform other actions while fleeing. Refer to <a href="#Flee-clara">Flee</a> in the Clarifications section.</p>
                <p class="page-break-after-print">If a player successfully flees from an enemy, the player and enemy will leave combat and the player can resume his <a class="rulebook" href="#Turn-sequence">Standard Turn Sequence</a> at step 4, and the enemy's health will be completely restored.</p>
                
                <h4>Slaying an enemy</h4>
                <p>When a player slays an enemy, the player places the enemy card into his hand.  Each enemy card has a gold amount, this is the enemy’s loot.  The card is treated like gold, and can be used to <a href="#Buy">buy</a> items in the <a href="#Shop">shop</a>, or <a href="#Trade">trade</a> with other players.  If two players are attacking an enemy, the player who dealt the last attack takes the enemy card.<br>
                When the enemy card is picked up, it should be replaced with a face-up <a href="#Pathing-tile">pathing tile</a> drawn from the pathing tiles stack.  The player may now resume his <a class="rulebook" href="#Turn-sequence">Standard Turn Sequence</a> at step 2 if he flipped over the enemy card, or at step 4 if he moved adjacent to the enemy.</p>
				<h4 id="Player-dies">Player dies</h4>
                <p>When a player’s health is reduced to 0 (or below) that player is dead.  However, this does not mean game-over for that player.  The player places his player token on any one of the <a href="#Starting-tile">starting tiles</a>.  He keeps one card of his choosing. If he still has cards, he places one card face-down on the tile he died on.

                The player's attack roll and max health are reset to their starting values. The player ends his turn and waits for his next turn to start over again.  The first player to move onto the tile with the face-down cards reveals the cards and puts them in his hand.</p>
                <h3 id="Interact">Interacting with other players</h3>
                <p>If a player is not in combat, he may interact with another player on his turn.  Some interactions benefit both parties, and some will betray your friend’s trust.  A player can only interact with another player that is on an <a href="#Adjacent-tile">adjacent tile</a>.</p>

                <p>A player may attempt to trip an adjacent player.  On his turn, the player can roll a die.  If he rolls a 4, 5, or 6 he successfully trips the player.  This means the tripped player loses his next turn, and the other player may leap over the tripped player’s token to one of that player’s <a href="#Adjacent-tile">adjacent tiles</a>.  This is useful if a player is blocking a path, or if two players are racing to a certain tile.</p>
                
                <p>A player may attempt to trip another player who is in <a href="#Combat">combat</a>.  If the roll is successful, the player in combat loses his next turn while remaining in combat.

All other players attacking an enemy can flee without rolling and do not trigger the enemy's ability if the enemy has one. If the player who is being attacked by the enemy <a class="rulebook" href="#Flee">flees</a>, the enemy will then turn to attack the next player who entered in combat.  This is true even if the fleeing character returns to attack the enemy.
                When an enemy dies, the player who dealt the last damage to that enemy takes the enemy card as loot.</p>

A player may <a href="#Sell">sell</a> any of his sellable items to the mole if he does not have enough gold to pay for the mole's services.  If the player still does not have enough gold, the mole takes all the player’s cards, excluding the <a href="#Unsellable">unsellable</a> cards, and aids the player.</p>
                <p>A player does not need to call on the aid of the mole; however, if all players are unable to lay new tiles, there are only two options:  1)either one, or multiple players, call on the aid of the mole, or 2) the game enters the <a class="rulebook" href="#End-rush">end rush</a>.</p>
